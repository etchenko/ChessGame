# ChessGame (In Progress)
The goal of this project is to create a Chess Engine (running on top of the python-chess package) which can play at a human-like level

The specific implementation of the chess engine has yet to be decided

## Requirements

To run this program, you need to install the python-chess library:
 ```
 pip3 install python-chess
 ```
## Implementation

The specific implementation has yet to be chosen, but will probably by a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
